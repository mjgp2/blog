      <description>Recently I have become interested in being able to look at the network traffic between Android apps and the internet, to be able to fully understand what bits and bytes are flying back and forth.
To do this we are going to effectively put a man-in-the-middle proxy between the application and the server like so:
server &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; proxy &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; android system &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; app I&amp;#8217;m doing this on my Mac, but it would be possible on other platforms, but you would need to adjust the file paths etc.</description>
